# What is this repo

A repo demonstrating the issue of TabTip not "notifying" WPF application of its presence.
Therefore - the keyboard is covering parts of the WPF application.

See (discussion)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30482440/wpf-window-size-not-affected-by-tabtip-keyboard] in StackOverflow

Tested on Windows 10 1803.
