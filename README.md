# What is this repo

A repo demonstrating the issue of TabTip not "notifying" WPF application of its presence.
Therefore - the keyboard is covering parts of the WPF application.

This behavior was different in Windows 8 - see [discussion](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a3845602-fc12-45b2-b9fd-a539eb502e49/touch-keyboard-no-longer-resizing-maximized-desktop-application?forum=win10itproapps) in Microsft's forum/

Also - see the [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30482440/wpf-window-size-not-affected-by-tabtip-keyboard) in StackOverflow.

# Tested on
 - Windows 10 1703
 - Windows 10 1803.
